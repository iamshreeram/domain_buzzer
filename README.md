# domain_buzzer
Domain availability checker

## Description 
The script utilizes the NameAPI API to perform a domain availability check. The script takes a predefined list of names stored in the 'names' array and a list of top-level domains (TLDs) stored in the 'domains' array.

The objective of the script is to check the availability of each name with each TLD combination by making API calls to NameAPI. Once the availability status is obtained, the results are written to a CSV file named 'output.csv'.

This script provides an efficient way to automate the process of checking domain availability for multiple names and TLDs. It simplifies the task of determining if a particular name is available for registration with various domain extensions. The resulting CSV file allows for easy analysis and comparison of domain availability data.
